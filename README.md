# nginx-open-metrics-service

A Go server that reads the data from nginx and expose for prometheus or grafana alloy to collect.

It runs every 15s to collect the data from nginx.

## nginx configuration

Create the file `statistics.conf` with the following content:

```
‚ùØ cat statistics.conf
server {
    listen 127.0.0.1:8080;
    location /api {
        stub_status;
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        deny all;
    }
}

```

Place the file on `/etc/nginx/conf.d` and reload the service.

```shell
‚ùØ mv statistics.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d
‚ùØ systemctl reload nginx
```

Check the interface is working with curl:

```shell
‚ùØ curl http://localhost:8080/api
Active connections: 1 
server accepts handled requests
 219 219 515 
Reading: 0 Writing: 1 Waiting: 0 
```

## starting service

```shell
‚ùØ ./nginx-openmetrics --service=http://localhost:8080/api
üöö fetching data from: http://localhost:8081/api
üé¨ starting service at port: 9090
```
